# Statistical Learning and Neural Networks
In this repository, there are the labs that we did during the *Statistical learning and Neural Networks* course at Politecnico di Torino. We learned the most important concepts and models of statistical learning and the basis of Neural Networks starting from how backpropagation works. In both cases, we have worked on simple exercises to better understand the theory behind machine learning methods and possible applications.
## Statistical Learning
1. K-NN Classifier
2. Generative models: QDA, LDA, Naive Bayes and Bayesian decision theory (ROC)
3. Principal Component Analysis
4. Kalman filter

## Convolutional Neural Networks
1. Digit recognition (MNIST)
2. Transfer learning
